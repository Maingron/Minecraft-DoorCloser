# Minecraft-DoorCloser
Minecraft (Spigot / Bukkit server) plugin to automatically close doors / gates / trap-doors that were opened by a player. 

You can configure which ones are in scope to be auto-closed, as well as if it should close when the player is in creative mode or is sneaking. I recommend leaving both of those as false to support using things like trap doors as decoration blocks (sides of chairs, etc.)

Requires
* Java 1.8
* Minecraft Spigot 1.12

Latest .jar file can be found in the /target folder

Standard configuration File can be found in /src/main/resources/config.yml. This was built with Spigot 1.12. If new door/gate/trap-door materials are added, you'll want to add them to the config file.
