# RespectEventCancellation
# This is an internal thing, mostly for debugging interaction
# with other plugins. The plugin should always ignore 
# canceled events unless you've found a very specific
# reason not to. True for normal behavior, false to process
# events even if they were canceled by another plugin.
RespectEventCancellation: true


# Time: Time (in integer seconds) to allow the door to remain open
# This is an estimate. How long it really stays open depends
# on how quickly Spigot can get to the event handler. It won't
# be faster than this, but will typically be slower, again, 
# depending upon server load, number of plugins running, etc.
Time: 5

# double-door handling. This is a bit outside the original scope
# of this plugin, but was a community request. It's optional here
# because you may already have plugins handling this, and so the
# behavior might be weird.
#
# SynchronizeDoubleDoorOpen: automatically open the second door
# when you click on one of the doors in a pair. Detection algorithm
# checks for where the hinges are located.
# SynchronizeDoubleDoorClose: same thing, but synchronizes closing
SynchronizeDoubleDoorOpen: true
SynchronizeDoubleDoorClose: true

# PlaySound: True if the door/gate/trapdoor closing sound should be played
PlaySound: true

# IgnoreIfInCreative: true if you want to ignore the door when the player 
# is in creative mode if this is not set to true, you'll never be able to 
# create an open door unless you turn on sneaking.
IgnoreIfInCreative: true

# IgnoreIfSneaking: true if you want to ignore the door when the player is 
# sneaking. This will work for all players, not just someone in creative
IgnoreIfSneaking: false

# EnableWorldGuardIntegration: true/false. True if you want to 
# enable integration with world guard. If false, the world guard-
# related settings will be ignored. If true, you must have a 
# compatible version of world guard on this server. The minimum
# wolrd guard version is 7.0
EnableWorldGuardIntegration: true

# UseWorldGuardFlag: true/false. True if you want to use the 
# world guard flag for handling which regions enable/disable
# this behavior. If you set this to false, you need to use
# the Regions group here in the config file
UseWorldGuardFlag: true

# WorldGuardFlag
# This is actual name of the flag used in WorldGuard. If you plan
# to change this, you need to do so before using the plugin, and 
# you must restart the server. Reloading the config is not enough.
# The plugin will register this flag on startup. If you change it
# later, you'll have an extra flag in WorldGuard. If you change
# it later and you've already used the old one, the flag value
# will be stored, but not used. You'll have to re-do your work.
WorldGuardFlag: door-closer-enabled

# OverlappingRegionPriorityBehavior: how to handle overlapping
